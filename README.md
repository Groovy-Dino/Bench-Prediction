# Bench-Prediction

Which key attributes of a lifter have the greatest impact on predicting their one-rep-max becn press?

Analysis of a data set (from Kaggle) containing features of the lifters: sex, equipment, age, bodyweight, best squat, best deadlift and best bench press.
Since there are many outliers within powerlifting, it is difficult to determine which of these features has an impact on predicting a lifters one-rep-max on bench press.

The code intends to fit the models (the selection of which reasoned in comments) with different comibinations of features for training. The combinations will be as follows: all features, all except best squat, all except best deadlift and all except best squat and best deadlift.
