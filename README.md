# Bench-Prediction

Which key attributes of a lifter have the greatest impact on predicting their one-rep-max bench press?

Analysis of a data set (from Kaggle) containing features of the lifters: sex, equipment, age, bodyweight, best squat, best deadlift and best bench press.
Since there are many outliers within powerlifting, it is difficult to determine which of these features has an impact on predicting a lifters one-rep-max on bench press.

The code intends to:<br>
-  Visualise the data, clean and remove outliers.
-  Fit the models (the selection of which reasoned in comments) with different comibinations of features for training.
-  Predict the one-rep-max for the user.
-  Evaluate the models, finding the best model then fidning the best parameters for that model.
